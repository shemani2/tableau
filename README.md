# Analysis

The top 10 starting and stopping stations can be seen on the corresponding maps which may indicate areas with more commute, whether for long-term or short-term users. The basic maps indicate there is a central station that is used to start and stop a ride which is informative of the flow of traffic around the area. 

Over three chosen months in 2019 shown on the line graph, there is a spike in the trip duration in June, which is a warmer month and more people are out and about which indicates the popularity of the services whereas it slows down in January and December when it is colder. 

The line graphs show the user type, a short-term customer or a long-term customer, for the evaluated months (Jan, June, and Dec) of 2019. There is a more significant number of short-term riders than long-term which indicates that members may be more committed to their rides whereas the short-term users may be tourists or riding as needed. There is also a spike of short-term riders in June which makes sense with the warmer months indicating more people are outdoors during that time. 

Looking at the riders by birth year and the average duration by birth year which is then filtered by customer and subscribers. Between the two we can see a larger group of subscribers which is interesting because they have the shortest distances traveled. On the flip side, there's a random spike in the 1970s of customers using the CitiBikes, which could be due to certain events happening or just a random coincidence. The short-term customers drove longer distances which could indicate tourists visiting and riding around. 

The bar graphs demonstrate the number of subscribers by bikeid and there's a spike in June which correlates with the previous analysis that there's an uptick in users in the warmer months. We also see a percent change in users in the monthly comparisons which indicates a drop during the colder months. However, there is a smaller percent change between the subscribers which demonstrates long-term users may be avid riders and/or athletes. 

Lastly, the heat maps are comparing the start times for the bike rides for January, June, and December 2019. In each map, there are more riders on the bikes in the early sunrise times and then the late sunset times. This indicates that a lot of riders are taking a bike ride before and after most people's work days which also indicates a routine that many people may have that they follow.
